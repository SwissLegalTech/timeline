        "content": "14/01/2018 Max Mustermann The outcome of the opposition depends to a great extent on the conclusions in relation to the evidence submitted by the opponent in order to prove the enhanced distinctiveness/well-known character/reputation of the earlier marks and their use of more than mere local significance. Therefore, in this section the Opposition Division will first set out the submitted evidence in its entirety and will determine whether the earlier allegedly well-known marks qualify as such; whether the earlier EUTM acquired enhanced distinctiveness/reputation and/or whether the earlier non-registered trade marks have been put to genuine use of more than mere local significance in the relevant territories.  In the present case, the contested trade mark was filed on 07/09/2012. Therefore, the opponent was required to prove that the signs on which the opposition is based were used in the course of trade of more than mere local significance or acquired reputation/are well-known in the designated territories prior to that date. The evidence must also show that the opponents signs have been used in the course of trade for the designated goods and services as specified above in the REASONS section of the decision.
